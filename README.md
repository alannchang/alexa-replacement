Simple python script that utilizes a few libraries to allow for voice-activated virtual assistant like behavior on the device of your choosing.  
This is my version of an "open-source Alexa" that focuses on the one feature that I use the most: playing music.  It works by using the Vosk voice recognition library
to interpret the user's voice, pyttsx3 library to provide vocal feedback to the user, and the Selenium engine to navigate and play videos on youtube.

Anyone who wants to build their own virtual assistant that can play music (like other voice assistants) might find this repository useful.  
I made this so I wouldn't have to keep paying my monthly Amazon Music Unlimited subscription and the added privacy is a plus.

I used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB RAM) running Raspbian OS as my dedicated device.

This is not intended to be a major project for me, but I will try my best to help anyone who is trying to recreate this for their own purposes.
